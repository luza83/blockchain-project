Achieving transparency has become a challenge in the supply chain. Sometimes, when not all players involved in this process act in a fair way, it becomes difficult to guarantee the provenance of a product. When it comes to seafood production, it is necessary to ensure that all fish sold and bought is weighed and labeled by each player through the value chain. A tool that keeps unalterable records of every move can be the solution to tackle this challenge.
Due to the characteristics associated to the blockchain (security, traceability, reliability, and transparency), it can be considered as a mean to improve processes in the supply chain. 

Based on the case presented by the Maritech guest lector Bjørnar Kvalsnes.  “True story” is a tool that allows each player in the supply chain to keep track of what they buy and sale. This tool allows each player to upload data to the blockchain and retrieve it, it provides an overview of where the product goes and how much is in or out within each stakeholder. If any player attempts to alter data, this will be easily reflected in the summary provided.

To complete this web application the following files where created:

4.	Home: Html file containing the main menu.
5.	Images: is a folder containing images used for style purposes.
6.	Node_modules: node library created for this project.
7.	Package-lock and package: JSON files with dependencies used.
8.	ShowTx: Js file created by browserify, to export node module contained in ups.js and use it in html
9.	Style: Css file to style all html files.
10.	tx_function: function that creates a raw transaction out of user input and broadcasts it to the blockchain.
11.	upload: html file that shows the overview of all transactions contained in one address
12.	ups: Js file with the function that retrieves all data transactions in one address and converts them to text, to further analyze them.
